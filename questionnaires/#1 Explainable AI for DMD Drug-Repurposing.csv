Does this happen in cell types and brain areas related to language? pak1 has functions in different cell types. I am no pak1 expert, but a quick google search shows that pak1 mutations have also been linked to speech delay and intellectual disability, which are relevant for DMD. I also miss the way the drug targets pak1. Will it inhibit or stimulate the target? DMD is a pediatric disease; has the drug been used/tested and deemed safe in pediatric populations? The drug also gives muscle spasms, which do not seem a workable side effect to have in children where the primary pathology is in muscle tissue."
